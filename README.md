This helped me refine my current understanding of flexbox and introduced a few edge cases to me. In addition I have identified places where my knowledge is lacking. 

+ Keeping CSS orderly and how to best apply styles as efficiently as possible.

+ Flexbox alignment and edge cases. Especially the direct child relationship of flex items and the interaction of items as the flow changes from flex-column to flex-row to block and back.

+ Design principles.

Things I am excited to dig into further. 

+ Emmet Abbreviations for speed.

+ Using CSS styles to achieve attractive design elements with minimal use of images. Previously I assumed buttons and icons were small images, learning that it is markup is eye opening.
